# PicturePerfect

## Problem
As high school students, we've had our fair share of presentations. Whether analyzing the heart-tugging Romeo and Juliet in front of the class or showcasing the impacts of American independence on modern civilization, we believe that presentation is an essential mode of communication that captures the nuances of vocal expression and bodily gestures. However, it is often a struggle to focus on everything outside of our speech--maintaining direct contact with the audience, enunciating each and every word correctly, or radiating the same excitement we have for the project--so we created Picture Perfect to help everyone picture their perfect presentation.

## Target Customers
Our primary target market is students in secondary school and university. Students are a huge portion of our customer segment because they give about 6 to 8 presentations a year and require an application like Picture Perfect to optimize their presentation.
Our secondary target market is business people because of the necessity to create pitches to demonstrate products, display presentations in a data-driven manner, or lobby for changes in policies within an organization. Presentations are critical to drive change and Picture Perfect will help many budding entrepreneurs.

## Solution
Picture Perfect has two major features to improve presentations around the world. 
1. Engagement Detection - Our mobile app utilizes CoreML to detect the coordinate points of the eyes and when the eyes are deviating from the center of the screen, the user is notified that they are in realtime.
2. Speech Analysis - Our mobile app utilizes a natural language processing library called SpeechRecognizer to calculate the words per minute of the user and notifies the user if they are speaking too quickly or slowly.

## Marketing Channels 
We have three major marketing channels--social media, word of mouth, and pay-per-click advertising.
We will utilize Twitter to provide constant tweets and updates to our applications, Reddit to create unique sub-communities that provide new ideas and feedback, and Facebook through targeted ads that reach people of all ages. Our passive channel is word of mouth which will help us generate popularity through shares between friends and family. Pay-per-click advertising will come in the form of Google Ads and Instagram Ads, redirecting people to our app with a simple click.

## Revenue Streams 
Our revenue comes through two forms: application partnerships and a PRO version of PicturePerfect. Application partnerships with presentation tools like Canva, Google Slides, and Microsoft Powerpoint will ensure simple access and seamless usage. A PRO version will allow us to generate revenue through ads and subscriptions.

## Competitive Advantage
PicturePerfect is the world's first application that provides real-time analytics on presentations and speeches. We will be obtaining a utility patent for our machine learning algorithms and presentation scheme, ensuring a unique experience that can't be replicated. Our business model is unique because we will partner with top-tier presentation tools before any other similar application and also have our own application to provide users with both opportunities to use the application. Also, PicturePerfect has low distribution costs because deploying to the App Store and Google Play Store only takes $125. We will constantly develop the application and have a technical strength that will position PicturePerfect as the leading presentation tool in the industry.
